N8N Workflow Prompt Framework & Guidelines
🎯 The PRECISE Framework for N8N Workflow Prompts
Use this structured approach to craft prompts that generate optimal n8n workflows:
P - Purpose & Problem Statement
What to Include:

Clear, specific description of the workflow's objective
Business problem being solved
Success criteria and expected outcomes
User personas who will interact with the workflow

Example:
"Create a customer support workflow that automatically categorizes incoming support emails, 
routes them to appropriate teams, and generates initial response suggestions using AI. 
Success means 90% accurate categorization and 50% faster response times."
R - Requirements & Resources
What to Include:

Specific node types required (AI Agent, HTTP Request, etc.)
External integrations needed (Salesforce, Gmail, Slack, etc.)
Data sources and destinations
Processing volume expectations
Performance requirements

Example:
"Requirements:
- Email Trigger node for IMAP monitoring
- AI Agent with GPT-4 for categorization and response generation
- Salesforce integration for ticket creation
- Slack notifications for urgent issues
- Handle 100+ emails daily
- Response time under 30 seconds"
E - Exact Data Flow & Structure
What to Include:

Input data format and source
Data transformations needed
Output format requirements
Specific field mappings
Error data handling

Example:
"Data Flow:
Input: Email with subject, body, sender, attachments
Transform: Extract key information, categorize priority (1-5), generate tags
Output: JSON with {category, priority, suggestedResponse, assignedTeam, ticketId}
Error Handling: Invalid emails go to manual review queue"
C - Configuration Specifics
What to Include:

AI model preferences and parameters
Authentication requirements
Environment variables
Rate limiting needs
Memory/context requirements

Example:
"Configuration:
- OpenAI: model='gpt-4', temperature=0.3 for consistent categorization
- Memory: maintain conversation context for follow-up emails
- Credentials: Gmail OAuth2, Salesforce API key, Slack webhook
- Rate limits: max 10 AI calls per minute"
I - Integration Details
What to Include:

Specific API endpoints and operations
Field mappings between systems
Webhook configurations
Third-party service requirements

Example:
"Integrations:
- Salesforce: Create case with fields (Subject, Description, Priority, Origin='Email')
- Slack: Post to #support-alerts for priority 1-2 issues
- Gmail: Mark emails as processed, add labels based on category"
S - Safety & Error Handling
What to Include:

Fallback mechanisms
Error notification requirements
Data validation rules
Security considerations

Example:
"Safety Measures:
- If AI categorization confidence < 70%, route to human review
- Failed Salesforce API calls retry 3 times, then email admin
- Sensitive data detection triggers secure handling process
- All API calls use stored credentials, never hardcoded keys"
E - Expected Output Format
What to Include:

JSON structure requirements
Node naming conventions
Documentation needs
Testing requirements

Example:
"Output Requirements:
- Complete JSON workflow ready for import
- Descriptive node names (e.g., 'AI Agent - Email Categorization')
- Sticky notes documenting key decision points
- All connections properly mapped
- No placeholder values or incomplete configurations"

🎉 Pro Tips for Maximum Success

Be Specific About AI Behavior: Instead of "use AI to process", specify "use AI to extract key entities (name, email, issue type) and classify urgency on 1-5 scale"
Include Real Examples: Provide sample input data and expected output formats
Think About Edge Cases: What happens with malformed data, API failures, or unexpected volumes?
Consider the Human Factor: Who will maintain this workflow? What level of complexity is appropriate?
Plan for Growth: How should the workflow scale as volume increases?
Security First: Always specify authentication, data protection, and access control requirements
Test-Driven Thinking: Include specific test scenarios and success criteria

Remember: The more detailed and structured your prompt, the more accurate and complete your n8n workflow will be!
